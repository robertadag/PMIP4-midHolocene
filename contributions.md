|Paragraph|Author|Editor|Description|
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
|1| | | An gentle introduction of the idea of using past simulations to evaluate future ones.|
|2| | | A description/layout of paper. Summarise past work, describe expt/methods, present simulations, compare to previous simulations, present data compilations, evaluate against these data compilations, discuss findings and potential for future analyses.|
|3| | | Explanation of the mid-Holocene as a climate period, in context of deglacation, Holocene and Anthropocene.|
|4| | | PMIP as part of CMIP. The midHolocene in previous PMIP efforts|
|5| | | model-only findings from previous PMIP midHolocene papers|
|6| | | data-model comparison findings from previous PMIP midHolocene papers|
|7| | | Bland introduction of methods|
|8| Charlie Williams | | Overview of midHolocene orbital conditions |
|9| | | Discussion of GHG concentrations and aerosols. Changes from PMIP3|
|10| | | Discussion of land cover specifications. State variety of ways to encode into GCMs. Role of dynamic veg (relate back to piControl specifications and DECK).|
|11| | | Introduce CMIP6 and DECK. Data available for download on ESGF. PMIP4 simulations are open to non-CMIP6 models, process for securing data not as obvious.|
|12| Chris Brierley | | Describe some basic ensemble features of PMIP4. Refer to Table \ref{tab:gcms}. Specify inclusion criteria.|
|13| | | Brief discussion of PMIP3 - stress no individual models identified here, so reference previous papers for that info|
|14| Patrick Bartlein | | Explain issue with calendar changes. Stress often not adjusted for in previous studies.|
|15| Patrick Bartlein | | introduce PaleoCalAdjust software.|
|16| Anni Zhao | | describe treatment of calendar adjustments in this paper, and highlight potential implications.|
|17| Chris Brierley | | Introduce CVDP. Highlight settings. Note all output data available to researchers, but only smattering shown in this papers. Rest for subsequent papers.|
|18| | | Monsoon domain definition. How treating calendar adjustment in this component. highlight differences to standard defintion, to better fit paleoruns/variability. Code available...|
|19| | | How calculate variables for data-model comparison - MTCO, MTWA, but mainly pseudocorals.|
|20| | | Bland introductory paragraph saying what is to come in this section, and that it is important.|
|21| | | Describe large-scale features - interhemispheric gradient etc from Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}. Compare to expected result from insolation forcings|
|22| | | Describe dominant seasonality changes from Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}.|
|23| | | Discuss ensemble consistency. Look at spread between GCMs. Say where high and low.|
|24| | | describe the differences between the PMIP generations by looking at the Fig. \ref{fig:tempdiff}|
|25| | | Significance - we don't plan to calculate this statistically (not sure of robust stats methid with these small, non-normal ensembles), but by comparing images we should speculate of the importance of any differences.|
|26| | Roberta D'Agostino | Describe large-scale features - ITCZ shift etc from Fig. \ref{fig:rainfall}. Compare to expected result from insolation forcings|
|27| | Roberta D'Agostino | Describe dominant seasonality changes from Fig. \ref{fig:rainfall}.|
|28| | | Discuss ensemble consistency. Look at spread between GCMs. Say where high and low.|
|29| | | describe the differences between the PMIP generations by looking at the Fig.from Fig. \ref{fig:rainfall||
|30| | | Significance - we don't plan to calculate this statistically (not sure of robust stats methid with these small, non-normal ensembles), but by comparing images we should speculate of the importance of any differences.|
|31| | Roberta D'Agostino | Description of what the global monsoon domain actually is|
|32| | Roberta D'Agostino| What do the models suggest for midHolocene changes in the global monsoon domain (Fig. \ref{fig:globalmonsoon})? |
|33| | Roberta D'Agostino| Describe changes in North African monsoon domain. Explain different metrics - expansion of area, average pr rate (Fig. \ref{fig:individualmonsoons})? |
|34| | Roberta D'Agostino| Describe changes in Asian monsoon domains. Compare PMIP4 to PMIP3|
|35| | Roberta D'Agostino | Describe changes other monsoons (S. Amer, N. Amer, AUSMC, S. African). Compare PMIP4 to PMIP3|
|36| Xiaoxu Shi and Gerrit Lohmann | | Brief description of (reconstructed) ocean changes at midHolocene - small variations in sea level, SSTs follow SAT (so already discussed), thoughts about AMOC reconstruction.|
|37| Xiaoxu Shi | | Description of changes in AMOC using Fig. \ref{fig:amoc}. They seem fairly non-existent so far)|
|38| Charlie Williams | | Sum up the results from the PMIP4 simulations. Mainly just repeat what's above.|
|39| | | Provide an overview of PMIP4 vs PMIP3. Conclude by commenting on whether we can treat both as a combined ensemble, or if fundamentally different.|
|40| | | Intro paragraph outlining benefits of DMC, and its potential uses. Shout back to previous efforts.|
|41| Darrell Kaufmann | | Describe the various mechanisms by which temperature can be reconstructed. Describe new data compilation coordinated by N. Arizona.|
|42|  Darrell Kaufmann | | Compare the latitudinal reconstructed temperatures to simulated changes. Resulting in something looking like Fig. \ref{fig:DTlatbands}.|
|43| Sandy Harrison | | Introduce pollen reconstructions of climate. Stress how can be used for multiple variables, adn mainstay of DMC in PMIP.|
|44| Sandy Harrison | | Describe new Cleator et al reconstruction and data assimilation procedure. State how it compares to Bartlein et al. reconstruction (like in Fig. \ref{fig:CleatorvsBart}).|
|45| Sandy Harrison  | | Compare Cleator et al reconstruction to PMIP simulations via Taylor diagram. Show invidual models, for different variables. Will look something like Fig. \ref{fig:taylor}.|
|46| | | Culminate this DMC section by making a "carpet plot" (e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:carpet}). Describe the method. And then a good few sentences unpicking its meaning. NOTE: IPCC SAY THEY DO NOT WANT THIS FIGURE, BUT RATHER AN UPDATE OF Fig9.11d INSTEAD.|
|47| Julien Emile-Geay | | Describe how we think ENSO was different during the midHolocene. Reference some papers. Introduce Emile-Geay et al (2015, Nature Geoscience) paper as the current compilation of paleoENSO|
|48| Julien Emile-Geay | | Describe pseudocoral method and advantagaes of using 'forward model' for DMC|
|49| Julien Emile-Geay | | Present and discuss comparison between PMIP4 ENSO, data and PMIP3. Will need a figure, perhaps something like Fig. \ref{fig:enso}|
|50| | | Provide and overarching summary of the data-model comparison. Provide preliminary answer as to whether PMIP4 is better that PMIP3. (I suspect it will be "In some cases, yes. In some places longstanding biases still exist though").|
|51| | | Make some recommendations about what datasets may be more informative in future. Basically just make a shout-out for upcoming data compilations. Comment on role of isotope enabled models (some here are, but we're not using that capacity) and forward proxy models.|
|52| | | Explain again what PMIP4 and its midHolocene simulation are|
|53| | | Summarise the model results shown in this paper. A sentence each on the various sections|temperatures, rainfall, monsoons, AMOC.|
|54| | | Summarise the data model comparison results. Say we have evaluated the models. Highlight possibility of formally bringing that evaluation through to projections with some past2future emergent constraint applications.|
